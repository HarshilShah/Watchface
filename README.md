# Watchface
 
This Playground was created as my submission for a scholarship to attend WWDC 2017. The submission was accepted.

_**Note:** I have updated this project since making my submission, and might make more changes in the future. Check out the [`wwdc-final`](https://github.com/HarshilShah/Watchface/tree/wwdc-final "The version of this project that I submitted to Apple") release if you want to take a look at the exact project I submitted to Apple._

## About
 
The goal was to create a collection of watchfaces, some replicated and some original, for the Apple Watch.

## Usage

Open the `Watchface.playground` file in Xcode or Swift Playgrounds and press run. You can swipe left or right across the watchface to switch to different ones.
